# Optimization

In these case examples, I employed the package cvxpy, an open source Python-embedded modeling language, to solve convex optimization problems. The case problems, seperated into part 1 and part 2 answer questions related to supply chain, resource allocation, finance, and investment showing the wide array of functions that the package cvxpy can help solve.

Some of the solutions for these convex optimization problems are as follows:

🏭 **1. Table detailing the optimal amount of raw ingredients that a factory can buy and store based on the busines model's constraint:**

These problems are also solved by **linear or non-linear equations** depending on the variables that are presented by each case example.
See the Jupyter Notebooks above to see how the codes work and the problems it can solve.

The cases above are done at "DSO 570 – The Analytics Edge: Data, Models, and Effective Decisions" in USC.
