# supply-chain-optimization

In these case examples, I employed the package cvxpy, an open source Python-embedded modeling language, to solve convex optimization problems. 

**Case Problems**: Supply chain routes, Storage, and Revenue optimization.

Some of the solutions for these convex optimization problems are as follows:

**1. Table detailing the optimal amount of raw ingredients that a factory can buy and store based on the busines model's constraint:**

**2. Solvers for Profit/Revenue Strategy**

These problems are also solved by **linear or non-linear equations** depending on the variables that are presented by each case example.
